### Getting and Cleaning Data

### Coursera Course Project - Week 4

### Adjustments to original downloaded original

Merging the training and the test sets to create one data set.
Extracting only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
Useing descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
Appropriately labeling the data set with descriptive variable names.
Creating a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

### Identifiers
#### Subject: integer, ranges from 1 to 30.

#### Activity: 6-values string:

- WALKING: subject was walking
- WALKING_UPSTAIRS: subject was walking upstairs
- WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS: subject was walking downstairs
- SITTING: subject was sitting
- STANDING: subject was standing
- LAYING: subject was laying

Measurements
As mentioned above,the variables remaining are just the calculatd means and standard deviations of these sets of data: (Even if I do not give a detailed description of what each data value means, you can see what it means by comparing it with the original data column.)
