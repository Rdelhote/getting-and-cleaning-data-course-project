# getting-and-cleaning-data-course-project
Coursera Course Project - Week 4
The purpose of this project is to demonstrate your ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set. The goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis. You will be graded by your peers on a series of yes/no questions related to the project. You will be required to submit: 1) a tidy data set as described below, 2) a link to a Github repository with your script for performing the analysis, and 3) a code book that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that you performed to clean up the data called CodeBook.md. You should also include a README.md in the repo with your scripts. This repo explains how all of the scripts work and how they are connected.

One of the most exciting areas in all of data science right now is wearable computing - see for example this article . Companies like Fitbit, Nike, and Jawbone Up are racing to develop the most advanced algorithms to attract new users. The data linked to from the course website represent data collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone. A full description is available at the site where the data was obtained:

Here are the data for the project:

https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip

You should create one R script called run_analysis.R that does the following.

Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

This repository contains the following files:

README.md, this file, which provides an overview of the data set and how it was created.
tidy_data.txt, which contains the data set.
CodeBook.md, the code book describing contents of the data set.
run_analysis.R, basically R script that was used to create the data set.

The source data set was downloaded from the Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Data Set:

The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, we captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. The experiments have been video-recorded to label the data manually. The obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data.

The sensor signals (accelerometer and gyroscope) were pre-processed by applying noise filters and then sampled in fixed-width sliding windows of 2.56 sec and 50% overlap (128 readings/window). The sensor acceleration signal, which has gravitational and body motion components, was separated using a Butterworth low-pass filter into body acceleration and gravity. The gravitational force is assumed to have only low frequency components, therefore a filter with 0.3 Hz cutoff frequency was used. From each window, a vector of features was obtained by calculating variables from the time and frequency domain.

Training and test data were first merged together to create one data set, then the measurements on the mean and standard deviation were extracted for each measurement (79 variables extracted from the original 561), and then the measurements were averaged for each subject and activity, resulting in the final data set.

Data set
The R script run_analysis.R can be used to create the data set, transforms it to obtain the final data setby following the these stages:

Download and unzip source data if it doesn't exist.
Read data.
Merge the training and the test sets on one data set.
Extract only values of the mean and standard deviation.
Change activity names of activities in the data set.
Label the data set with values names.
Generate a tidy set with the average of variables, activities and subjects.
Write the data set to the tidy_data.txt file.
The tidy_data.txt in this repository using the run_analysis.R script with R version 3.6.1 (2019-07-05) on x86_64-apple-darwin15.6.0 edition.
